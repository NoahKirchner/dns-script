You should read this before running the setup.sh script.

This is a fairly simple script. Before you run it, ensure that:

* The DNS server can connect to the internet

* You have run the following:
sudo apt install bind9
sudo apt install dnsutils

Or that the previous packages are already installed on the server.

If anything breaks without an error message then I would recommend starting over and
following this website, "https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-domain-name-service-dns".
This script will create .backup files for any file it modifies.
